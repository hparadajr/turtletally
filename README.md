# Turtle Tally Mark Generator

As part of my Python programming practice, this project utilizes the Turtle graphics library to visually generate tally marks based on user input. The program prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 100, then draws the corresponding number of tally marks on the screen using a structured grouping system. Every fifth tally is represented as a diagonal line crossing the previous four, mimicking traditional hand-drawn tallying. The program includes input validation to ensure proper user interaction and adapts its layout by wrapping tally groups onto new rows as needed. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, and graphical output, making it a strong example of integrating logic with visual representation in an interactive way.

## Features
- Interactive user prompt for number of tally marks (1–100)
- Visual drawing of tally marks using Python’s Turtle graphics
- Accurate grouping: every fifth mark is a diagonal slash across the previous four
- Automatic row wrapping for neat display of large numbers
- Input validation for robust user interaction
- Fast drawing for quick visual feedback

## Skills Demonstrated
- Looping and control flow
- Input validation and error handling
- User interaction through prompts
- Graphical output using Turtle library
- Adapting layout based on user input

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (Turtle is included with standard Python installations).
3. Run the tally mark generator:
4. Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted. The tally marks will be drawn on the screen.

**Example:**
```
Please enter a number of tally marks between 1-100: 17
[Seventeen tally marks are drawn, with every fifth mark as a diagonal]
ALL DONE!
```
